A modern, production-ready Next.js template utilizing Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, and a clean project structure with built-in internationalization (i18n) support. This template is designed for building robust and scalable full-stack applications with clear separation of concerns, easy testing, comprehensive i18n capabilities, and high maintainability.

## 💡 Why This Template?

While standard Next.js starters or Create React App provide a blank canvas, they leave you spending hours (or days) configuring architectural foundations, linting rules, state management, and internationalization. This template targets **Enterprise-Grade Readiness** from minute zero.

- **Pre-Configured Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest, and Playwright are interlinked instantly. No conflicting configurations.
- **Scalable Architecture vs. Flat Folders:** Replaces the typical flat `src/` directory with a structured, feature-based layered architecture meant to hold hundreds of components without becoming a "spaghetti" mess.
- **Built-In Internationalization:** `react-i18next` is pre-configured with English and Turkish support, including localized validation/error/success messages ready for backend integration.
- **Strict State Separation:** Enforces best practices out of the box—Zustand handles global UI state, while React Query exclusively manages asynchronous server state and caching.
- **Next.js Server Components Ready:** Leverages Next.js 16 App Router with locale-based routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Immediate E2E Testing:** Playwright is pre-installed and configured. You don't have to bolt it on later when the project is already complex.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Philosophy

This template strictly follows a **Feature-Based / Layered UI Architecture with Next.js Server Components**:

- **API Abstraction Layer (`src/lib/api`):** All external data fetching is isolated here. UI components never call `fetch` or `axios` directly. Uses Axios for consistent HTTP client behavior.
- **Shared UI Primitives (`src/components/ui`):** Uses Radix UI + Tailwind for a highly customizable, accessible, and unstyled base. Includes shadcn integration.
- **Domain / Feature Modules:** Complex parts of the app are encapsulated by feature, not just by file type. Auth and protected routes follow convention-based routing.
- **Global vs Local State:** Global UI state is handled purely by `Zustand` (located in `src/stores`), while remote data is handled by `React Query`.
- **Locale-Based Routing:** Built-in support for multi-language routing using Next.js dynamic segments (`[locale]`).

## 🔗 Backend Compatibility

This frontend template is designed to seamlessly integrate with the companion **FastAPI Layered Architecture Template**.
You can find the backend template here: [kemalcalak/fastapi-template](https://github.com/kemalcalak/fastapi-template).

The API proxy is pre-configured in `next.config.ts` to forward requests from your app to the backend API.

## ✅ CI/CD Ready

The repository structure supports standard Continuous Integration pipelines out-of-the-box. Ensure you configure your CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to run:

1.  **Dependency Install:** `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
2.  **Linting:** `pnpm run lint`
3.  **Formatting Check:** `pnpm run format:check`
4.  **Unit & Component Tests:** `pnpm vitest run` (Vitest)
5.  **Type Checking & Build:** `pnpm run build`
6.  **E2E Tests:** `pnpm run test:e2e` (Playwright)

---

## 📦 Setup & Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- **`pnpm` package manager** (strictly recommended for this project)
  - `pnpm` offers faster dependency resolution, better disk space efficiency, and strict dependency isolation compared to npm. It's configured in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `package.json` for optimal monorepo support and lockfile consistency.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project folder and install the required dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (or copy from `.env.example`) and configure your API endpoints:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PREFIX=/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=MyApp
```

**Environment Variables Explained:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Base URL of your FastAPI backend server
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PREFIX`: API version prefix (commonly `/api/v1`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`: Application name displayed throughout the UI

### 3. Start the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🛠️ Available Scripts / Commands

This project uses `pnpm` to manage dependencies and run scripts. Below are the key commands available:

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the App

- **`pnpm run dev`**: Starts the local Next.js development server with hot reload.
- **`pnpm run build`**: Compiles TypeScript and builds the app for production into the `.next` directory.
- **`pnpm start`**: Starts the production server (requires `pnpm run build` first).

### 🧪 Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and component testing, and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for End-to-End (E2E) testing.

- **`pnpm run test`**: Runs unit and component tests via Vitest (currently not configured, ready for setup).
- **`pnpm run test:e2e`**: Runs Playwright E2E tests in the `tests-e2e` folder to simulate user interactions across the entire application.
- **`pnpm run test:e2e:report`**: Shows the Playwright test report from the latest test run.

### 🧹 Code Quality & Formatting

This project uses ESLint v9 for catching logical errors and Prettier for code formatting.

- **`pnpm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to find problems in your code.
- **`pnpm run format`**: Automatically formats all supported files using Prettier.
- **`pnpm run format:check`**: Checks if files are properly formatted (useful for CI/CD pipelines).

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

This template comes with a fully configured `react-i18next` setup supporting **English (en)** and **Turkish (tr)**:

### Add a New Language

1. Create new language files in `src/i18n/locales/{lang}/`:

   ```
   src/i18n/locales/de/ (for German)
   ├── auth.json
   ├── common.json
   ├── validation.json
   └── ...
   ```

2. Update `src/i18n/config.ts` to import and register the new language

3. Update `src/i18n/server.ts` if you need server-side language detection

### Using Translations in Components

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation(["auth", "common"]);
  return <h1>{t("common:welcome")}</h1>;
}
```
